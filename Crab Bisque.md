## Ingredients
4 Tbsp butter
1 Small sweet onion, diced
2 Ribs of celery, diced
4 Cloves crushed garlic
¼ cup flour
3 Tbsp tomato paste
Splash of dry white wine
1 Can diced fire roasted tomatoes
1 ½ tsp Old Bay seasoning
4 Cups fish stock
2 Bay leaves
1 Cup heavy cream or half and half
1lb Lump crabmeat, picked through for shells
Salt to taste
Chives to garnish


## Instructions
In a large dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat. Sautee the onion and celery for several minutes until they begin to soften and the onion becomes translucent. Add garlic and continue cooking for about a minute until the garlic becomes fragrant.
Add in the tomato paste, Old Bay seasoning, and flour. Cook about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. The paste will darken in color and the flour will begin to stick to the bottom of the pot.
Deglaze with a splash of white wine. Be sure to scrape up anything that may be clinging to the bottom of the pot.
Once the alcohol evaporates off, add in your can of diced tomatoes, fish stock, and bay leaves. Crank up your heat and let the soup reach a boil. Once boiling reduce the heat and let the soup simmer for about 20 minutes. Taste and adjust for seasoning.
Remove your bay leaves. Using an immersion blender, puree the soup until it is silky and smooth. Add in your heavy cream and bring it up to temp.
Taste your soup again and adjust for seasoning again if needed, Stir in your crab meat and let it warm thru. You can reserve some crab meat for garnish if you like. Serve right topped with additional crab meat and chives.
