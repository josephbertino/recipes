# Coconut-Ginger Vegetable Stir Fry

**Ingredients:**

- 2 tbsp ghee
- 1 large onion, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp fresh ginger, grated
- 1-2 bell pepper, sliced
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 cup snap peas or snow peas
- 1 medium carrot, julienned
- 1-2 zucchini, sliced
- 3/4 cup coconut milk
- 3 tbsp unsweetened coconut flakes
- 2 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce or tamari
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tsp sesame oil

Optional:
- 1/2 to 3/4 cup fresh Thai basil leaves (torn into pieces)
- Red pepper flakes to taste
- Fresh cilantro for garnish
- Toasted sesame seeds for garnish

**Instructions:**
1. Heat coconut oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Add onion and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until softening. Add garlic and ginger, cooking for another minute until fragrant.
3. Add the harder vegetables first (broccoli, carrots, bell pepper) and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes.
4. Add snap peas and zucchini, continuing to stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until all vegetables are tender-crisp.
5. In a small bowl, whisk together coconut milk, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil.
6. Pour in coconut milk, add coconut flakes, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and red pepper flakes
7. Add the Thai basil leaves (optional) and toss everything together for 1-2 minutes - the heat will wilt the basil and release its amazing aroma
8. Garnish with cilantro and toasted sesame seeds


**Thai Basil Tips**
Add the Thai basil at the very end to preserve its flavor and prevent overcooking
Thai basil has a more intense, slightly spicy-sweet flavor than regular basil
If you can't find Thai basil, regular basil works too, but use a bit less

The Thai basil will give this dish an authentic Southeast Asian flavor that pairs perfectly with coconut and ginger!
